jingle all the way
deck the halls
sleigh bells ring
o christmas tree
walking in a winter wonderland
frosty the snowman
dreaming of a white christmas
momma kissing santa claus
grandma got run over by a reindeer
rudolph the red nose reindeer
chesnuts roasting on an open fire
silent night
only a hippopotamus will do
blue christmas without you
want a plane that loops the loop
making a list checking it twice
friends call me snow miser
no more toymakers to the king
where are you christmas
mood is right spirits up
make the yuletide gay
born is the king of israel
the weather outside is frightful
all i want for christmas is you
joy to the world
the new old fashioned way
o holy night
sweet silver bells
do you hear what i hear
the holly that well bring
here comes santa claus
good king wenceslas
herald angel sings
a partridge in a pear tree
baby its cold outside
feliz navidad
polar express
youre a mean one mr grinch
very first christmas to me
kidnap the sandy claws
green sleeves was all my joy
island of misfit toys
silver and gold
christmas in july
if momma meets jesus tonight
let there be snow
its raining sunshine
the year without a santa claus
grandpas gonna sue the pants off of santa
nutcracker

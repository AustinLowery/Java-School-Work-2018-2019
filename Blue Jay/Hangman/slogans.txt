eat fresh
have it your way
im loving it
its finger licking good
when youre here youre family
are you in good hands
save fifteen percent or more
taste the rainbow
red bull gives you wings
just do it
save money live better
snap crackle pop
melts in your mouth no in your hands
it keeps going and going and going
whats in your wallet
like a good neighbor state farm is there
the quicker picker upper
america runs on dunkin
got milk
open happiness
a diamond is forever
the happiest place on earth
so easy a caveman can do it
when you care enough to send the very best
nothing runs like a deere
every kiss begins with kay
tastes so good cats ask for it by name
obey your thirst
all the news thats fit to print
trix are for kids
theyre magically delicious
im cuckoo for cocoa puffs
winston tastes good like a cigarette should
broadcast yourself
follow your nose for the fruity taste that shows
have a break have a kit kat
maybe its maybelline
for everything else theres mastercard
think different
the best part of waking up is folgers in your cup
chevy runs deep
its in the game
if your grandfather hadnt worn it you wouldnt exist
the snack that smiles back
what would you do for a klondike bar
comfort where you want it
its not delivery its digiorno
i want you for the us army
its bo time
the worlds first animated talking toy
